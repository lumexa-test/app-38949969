You wrote functional browser tests for a live web app (tests in
`${WORK}/harness/tests/`, PRD in `${WORK}/PRD.md`, live app at `${APP_URL}`,
admin login in env `ADMIN_EMAIL` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `playwright` MCP browser
tools available). This is black-box testing: you have no app source code —
judge only by the PRD and what the live app does in the browser.

The latest run's failures are in `${WORK}/failures.md`. Before anyone changes
the app because of them, each failure must be a REAL functional bug.

For every failing test, reproduce it in the browser and decide:
- The test is wrong — bad selector, wrong assumption about how the feature
  works, or it checks something that is not functional (wording, labels, copy,
  exact routes, HTTP codes, internals, third-party integrations, out-of-scope
  items) → fix the test, or delete that assertion/test. A test that fails only
  because a page, feature or field has a different URL or name than the PRD
  says is a wrong test — point it at the real one that does that job.
- The feature genuinely does not work as the PRD requires → leave it failing.

A failure that only proves WHERE the app sent the user (which URL or page after
login, sign-out or a refused request), a CSS class, or a network call is a wrong
test even when the PRD describes that route — rewrite it to check the effect
(signed out = the signed-in area is unreachable and sign-in is offered) and
keep it only if the effect itself is broken.

Exception — files named `integration-*.spec.ts` test the app's INSTALLED
integrations on purpose (`${WORK}/integrations.md` lists them and the rules for
testing them). For those, "it checks an integration" is not a reason to change
or delete the test; they are wrong only if they break those rules, use a bad
selector, or expect the integration somewhere the PRD does not put it.

Do not weaken a test that catches a real functional bug. Do not change the app.

When done, run the whole suite in the FOREGROUND and wait for it to finish:
`cd ${WORK}/harness && npx playwright test`
Never run it in the background and never stop while it is running. End with the
list of remaining failures and, for each, the functional bug it proves.

Never echo, print, log or write the admin password or any token anywhere (no
`echo $ADMIN_PASSWORD`, no writing it to files) — read it from `process.env` only.
